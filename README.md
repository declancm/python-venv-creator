# python-venv-creator
A fast and easy python virtual environment created for linux with some pre-installed libraries.

## Dependencies:
The following need to be installed (installation commands are for Ubuntu / Debian):
- python3:
  - sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  - sudo apt install python3
- pip3:
  - sudo apt install python3-pip
- python-venv:
  - python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv

## Instructions:
To run the script, the following command needs to be run from the script location:
- source pyvenv.sh

The script can be copied into the location where the python venv (or venvs) will be created, so only '.' is required for the directory path input.
